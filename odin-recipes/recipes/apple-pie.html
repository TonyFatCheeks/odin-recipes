    <h2>The Secret to Making Bakery-Quality Apple Pie</h2>
    <p>
        Here's the biggest secret for great apple pie: Toss your apples 
        with the rest of the filling (including spices, flour, butter, 
        and both light and brown sugars), and let it sit overnight. The 
        sugar will draw out the liquid from the apples, which is key for 
        a moist, not soggy, filling. But don't discard the juices; they're 
        liquid gold. Reduce them in a sauce pot, then once it's thick and 
        syrupy, add it back to the apples. You'll be rewarded for your hard 
        work with a more concentrated, deep and rich flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also don't reach for any old apples; you want a balance of flavors with 
        a crisp bite. Granny Smiths will give you the best combination of 
        juicy and tart. Don't forget to peel them before coring and 
        chopping—those skins are too tough and fibrous for pie.

        Emrbace the upper crust. A deep golden-brown crust really seals the 
        deal on a hot apple pie—it's what makes it a true show-stopping number. 
        Don't rely on your oven's heat alone to get that burnished color. Brush 
        the crust generously with egg wash before baking; the egg will help it 
        brown without over-baking.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>5 Granny Smith apples--peeled, cored quartered, and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 (9 inch) refrigerated prerolled pie crusts</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into small chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Place 1/2 cup butter into a heavy cast iron skillet, and 
            melt butter in the oven. Remove skillet and sprinkle with 
            brown sugar; return to oven to heat while you prepare the 
            apples.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove skillet, and place 1 refrigerated pie crust on top 
            of the brown sugar. Top the pie crust with half the sliced 
            apples. Sprinkle apples with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 teaspoon 
            of cinnamon; place a second pie crust over the apples; top 
            the second crust with the remaining apples, and sprinkle with 
            1/2 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Top with the third crust; 
            sprinkle the top crust with 1/4 cup sugar, and dot with 1 
            tablespoon of butter. Cut 4 slits into the top crust for steam.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are tender and the 
            crust is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
