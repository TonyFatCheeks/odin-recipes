    <h2>Secrets to Making the Best Lasagna Dish at Home</h2>
    <p>
        While packing your lasagna with vegetables and lean meats adds nutritional value, using no-boil 
        noodles will improve the taste. They are typically thinner than the dry noodles and absorb the tomato 
        sauce well. Also, you won’t have to wait for the noodles to cook. Using pork sausage instead of ground 
        beef for your tomato sauce will bring your pasta dish to a different level of satisfaction. You can 
        choose to mix sweet and spicy sausage to enhance the flavor of the sauce. Instead of using grated 
        mozzarella, add fresh mozzarella instead. You’ll notice that the rich diary flavor is tasty and the 
        texture is smooth.

        If you’ve never thought about using eggs in a lasagna dish, now is a great time to try. When coupled 
        with parmesan cheese and herbs, eggs round out the flavor and create a creamy texture filling that 
        is mouth-watering. Lastly, when you’re adding vegetables, you’ll want to add the right ones that don’t 
        turn soggy while baking. While this can be fixed by pureeing your vegetables before they are added to 
        the sauce, you can also use spinach. Adding spinach is a great alternative to including vegetables and 
        adding flavor.
