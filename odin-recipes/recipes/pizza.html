    <h2>The Secrets to Making a Pizzeria-Quality Pizza Every Time</h2>
    <p>
        Flour is the main ingredient in pizza dough, and the type you use can have 
        a big effect on the end result. All-purpose flour will work fine, but if 
        you want a chewier crumb and a better hole structure, you should consider 
        buying yourself some high protein bread flour. I use either King Arthur-brand 
        bread flour, or imported Antimo Caputo bread or pizza flour (which is ground 
        more finely than its American flour counterparts).
    </p>
    <p>
        Cold fermenting your dough—that is, storing it in the refrigerator after forming
         it—can help improve both its flavor and its browning characteristics as the yeast 
         slowly gets to work digesting carbohydrates.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the tests that I've done, dough gets better and better over the course of a few 
        days in the refrigerator, peaking at about 3 days. When I have the time, I'll make 
        my dough, throw it in a zipper-lock bag, and refrigerate it for a few days because 
        taking it out, shaping it, and allowing it to proof at room temperature before 
        stretching and baking.
